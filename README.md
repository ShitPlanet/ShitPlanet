ShitPlanet aims to burn the shit tokens in the community. In order to reward this purification behavior, we will grant users a limited edition NFT, and users can participate in farming our platform tokens through the NFT power and use our platform tokens to join the democratic governance to build a clean and positive community.


## Features

### Minting NFT

Based on the total value of the shit token users choose to burn, the system will determine what card to mint. Basically, it will follow the following rules,

- $1 ~ 10 - Rank 1, AHL No.02
- $10 ~ 100 - Rank 2, Alien Skull
- $100 ~ 1000 - Rank 3, Pistal Antenna 
- $1000 ~ 10000 - Rank 4, Counterfeit Skull
- $10000 ~ 100,000 - Rank 5, AHL No.05
- $100,000+ - Rank 6, Alien Shit

50% of the shit tokens to be burnt will be destroyed immediately, and for the remaining 50% tokens will be converted into USDT. The platform will use 50% of USDT to buy our platform token SHIT and combine with the other 50% USDT, to add liquidity, when we get the LP token, the LP token will be destroyed directly.


Each card has 5 levels, and it will be **randomly** determined when clicking to minting NFT. The corresponding color is demonstrating the level.


- White: Common
- Green: Unique
- Blue: Rare
- Red: Epic
- Gold: Legend


### NFT List

Based on the rank and the level, each NFT card will have its own determined mining power. Users will see the NFT list he get by destroying shit tokens. And the card will demonstrate the burnt amount and value and burnt time information, etc. Users also can use our platform token SHIT to upgrade the NFT card's mining power by clicking the upgrade button to burn our platform token SHIT.


### NFT Stake Mining

Click each card, it will pop up a window to show the `stake` or `unstake` button based on the NFT card status. By default, the NFT card users get will not be activated to mine, users need to stake the NFT card to mine by hand. On the top-left, the blackhole icon is demonstrating its status. Spinning blackhole means mining.
